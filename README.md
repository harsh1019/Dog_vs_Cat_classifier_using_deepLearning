# Dog vs Cat Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Project Overview

The Dog vs Cat Classifier project is designed to accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project showcases the application of deep learning techniques in image classification, covering data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Dataset Collection**: Utilized the Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Applied techniques like rotation, zooming, horizontal flipping, and rescaling.
   - **Normalization**: Scaled pixel values for standardized input data.

2. **Model Architecture**
   - **Convolutional Layers**: Extract and learn features from images.
   - **Pooling Layers**: Down-sample feature maps while retaining essential information.
   - **Fully Connected Layers**: Integrate features and perform classification.
   - **Dropout Regularization**: Reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

3. **Model Training and Validation**
   - **Training-Validation Split**: Monitored model performance to avoid overfitting.
   - **Early Stopping**: Halted training when performance ceased to improve.
   - **Model Checkpointing**: Saved the best model weights during training.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Accuracy and Loss Tracking**: Evaluated model performance over epochs.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized classification performance.
   - **ROC Curve and AUC**: Comprehensive performance evaluation.

5. **Deployment**
   - **Model Serialization**: Serialized the trained model using Keras’s `model.save` function.
   - **Inference Pipeline**: Preprocessed new input images and generated real-time predictions.

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Libraries**: Keras with TensorFlow backend
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Model Evaluation**: scikit-learn

- **Optional Deployment Tools**: Flask, Docker, AWS/GCP

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harsh1019/dog-vs-cat-classifier.git
   cd dog-vs-cat-classifier
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**
   - Download the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Run the data preprocessing script to augment and normalize the images.
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**
   - Train the model using the prepared dataset.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using the validation set.
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. **Model Inference**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path_to_your_image.jpg
   ```
